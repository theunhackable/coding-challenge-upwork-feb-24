# Summation Function

I solved the 3 variatoins of this problem and given description for each algorithm's complexity in the comments of the [SumationFunctions.js](/challenge-1/SummationFunctions.js) file.

You can run this using node assuming /challenge-1 as your current working directory.

```bash
node SumationFunctions.js [number > 1]
```

Example:

```bash
node SumationFunctions.js 12
```

Output:

```bash
simple summation:  78
recursive summation:  78
formula summation:  78
```
