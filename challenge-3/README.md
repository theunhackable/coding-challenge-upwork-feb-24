# Challenge 3

I developed a login form that displays error messages if there are any errors, after submission.

## Dependencies

- vite - to initilize the project
- tailwindcss - for styling


## How to use ?

Assuming `/challenge-3` is your current working directory:

- Run `npm ci` command to install the required dependencies.
- Run `npm run dev` command to start a development server on port `5173` by default.
- After that you can test the this reacct page on your browser.
