# Coding Challenge 1: Summing Up to N in Three Ways

## Objective
Demonstrate your problem-solving and coding skills by writing three distinct functions in any programming language of your choice. Each function should sum up to the number n in a unique way.

## Tasks
1. Simple Summation Function: Write a function that takes an integer n and returns the sum of all integers from 1 to n using a loop.

2. Recursive Summation Function: Write a recursive function to perform the same task: summing all integers from 1 to n.

3. Mathematical Formula Implementation: Implement a function that uses the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series to find the sum of all integers from 1 to n.

## Submission Guidelines
- Provide your code in a single file with clear comments explaining your logic.
- Include a brief explanation (either in the code comments or in a separate document) on why each method was chosen and the advantages/disadvantages of each approach.
- Ensure your code is well-formatted and easy to read.

## Evaluation Criteria
- Correctness: Each function should correctly compute the sum to n.
- Code Quality: Code should be well-organized and clearly commented.
- Creativity: Show us your unique approach to solving problems.
